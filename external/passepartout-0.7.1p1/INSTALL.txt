(1) Dependencies

(*) objconfig
(*) simplejson if your python is 2.5 or less.
(*) echo-0.9.3.tar.gz for testing

(2) Install

First, install passepartout-x.x.x.tar.gz to your python env.

(3) Create a dir to host application config files

Choose a dir to host config files of backend applications.
Sample config files are available under
./sample/application/conf/* inside passepartout-x.x.x.tar.gz

(3) Configure passepartout for apache

Copy ./conf/cgi.passepartout.conf in tarball passepartout-x.x.x.tar.gz
to apache's conf.d dir and modify its content for your environment.

Most importantly, in this file, you need to

(a) set up environment variable SERV10N_APP_CONF_DIR
which points to the dir that you created in step (3) above

(b) set up directive ScriptAlias to the location of
installed */passepartout/wsgi/index.py (result of step (2) above), next
modify the very first line in the index.py file to the path of
python executable of your python env and make sure it is executable too.

This runs service as CGI.

Use ./conf/wsgi.passepartout.conf if running service as WSGI.

(5) Test

restart apache and point your browse to, e.g. (trailing "/" is important),

(*) http://localhost:8080/service/
which shall list usages of all available applications

(*) http://localhost:8080/service/echo/
which shall list the usage of an application based on python module echo

(*) http://localhost:8080/service/echo1/
which shall list the usage of an application based on bash script echo1
