****TO INSTALL THE CLIENT FRONT END:

Inside js/openlayers_local.js, line 16:
MODIFY var serv10n_serverBase without a following slash to match the 
server where you have the service running i.e.: 
var serv10n_serverBase = 'http://mipldevwebify1:18080';

Note that if you have serv10n mapped to another subdirectory structure than /service/hsifind 
You may have to modify var hsi in js/openlayers_local.js, line 11:
hsi = new hsiFind(serv10n_serverBase+'/service/hsifind/','map');

CHANGES V0.9

****ROADMAP:
1. (implemented 0.9) Hold shift to select multiple spectra
2. Convert client app code structure from prototypal inheritance into Twitter Flight framework for longterm maintainability
